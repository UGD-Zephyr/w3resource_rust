C Basic-II [7 exercises with solution]
[An editor is available at the bottom of the page to write and execute the
scripts.]

1. Write a C program that takes n number of positive integers. Find the
integer that appears the least number of times among the said integers. If
there are multiple such integers, select the smallest one. Go to the editor

Sample Date:
(1,2,3) -> 1
(10, 20, 4, 5, 11) -> 4

2. Write a C program that takes a string and two integers (n1, n2). Now
reverse the sequence of characters of the string between n1 and n2. Go to the
editor
Sample Date:
("abcdxyabcd", 5, 6) -> "abcdyxabcd"
("Exercises", 1, 3) -> "exercises"

3. Write a C program that accepts three integers from the user and find second
largest number among these. Go to the editor
Constraints:

1≤ x ≤100
1≤ y ≤100
1≤ z ≤100
Sample Date:
(1 , 2, 3) -> 2
(10, 12, 24) -> 12
(34, 21, 30) -> 30

4. Write a C program that accepts two sequences ((a1, a2, .. an), (b1, b2, ..
bn)) of integers as input. Find all integers that appear in both sequences,
one by one, in ascending order. Go to the editor
Constraints:

1≤N1≤100, N1 -> number of integers in first sequence.
1≤N2≤100, N2 -> number of integers in second sequence.
1 ≤ ai≤ 100 ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N1 )
1 ≤ bj≤ 100 ( 1 ≤ j ≤ N2 )
Sample Date:

( 1 2 3 1 2 3 4) -> 1 2 3
( 1 2 3 1 2 3) -> 1 2 3
(1 2 3 4 5 6) ->

5. Write a C program that accept a sequence of different values and calculate
the sum of the values before, after the maximum value. Go to the editor
The sum of the values before the maximum value is 0, if there are no values
before the maximum. Similarly, the sum of the values after the maximum value
is 0, if there are no values after the maximum.
Sample Date:

1 2 3 -> 3 0
1 2 9 4 5 -> 3 9
2 2 2 2 -> 0 6

6. Write a C program that accept a sequence of positive integers from the user
and find the length of the longest continuous subsequence from the said
sequence. Go to the editor
Sample Date:

Length of the sequence: 5
Sequence: 5 2 3 4 1
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 5 [2 3 4]
Length of the sequence: 6
Sequence: 10 20 30 40 50 60
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 6 [10 20 30 40 50 60]
Length of the sequence: 3
Sequence: 5 1 3
Length of longest ascending contiguous subsequence: 2 [1 3]

7. Write a C program that accepts three integers A, B, X. Out of the integers
between A and B (inclusive) find the smallest absolute value of difference
from X. Go to the editor
Sample Date:

Input A, B: 7, 11
C: 20
Smallest absolute value of difference between X and integers between A and B
(inclusive): 11
Input A, B: 1, 5
C: 4
Smallest absolute value of difference between X and integers between A and B
(inclusive): 4
