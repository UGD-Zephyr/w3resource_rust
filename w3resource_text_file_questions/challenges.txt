26. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by
multiplying two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that
is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the
only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.
However, 6 is composite because it is the product of two numbers (2 × 3) that
are both smaller than 6.
